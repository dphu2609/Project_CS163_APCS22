# Project_CS163_APCS22: Data Structure Visulization

## Introduction

Data Structure Visualization is a program that allows users to visualize the behavior of common data structures. This program is written in C++ and uses the SFML library for graphics rendering.

## Features
This program currently supports the following data structures:
- AVL Tree
- 2-3-4 Tree
- Trie
- Heap
- Graph
- Hash table

Main features included:
- Smooth animations of the algorithms responsible for inserting, deleting, searching, and updating values in the data structure.
- Control the speed of the animations and play, pause or reverse the animations.
- Step-by-step code highlight.
- Create random and load-from-file list.
